  In the past couple years, battery-powered tools for yardwork (also called
  Outdoor Power Equipment / OPE) have become increasingly popular. If you've
  been into a big box hardware store, you've probably seen a futuristic leaf
  blower or even a riding lawnmower and wondered to yourself whether it was
  worth the fuss.  In short, the answer is "YES" - though what works best will
  depend on your unique situation. In an effort to help homeowners understand
  this, I've put together this primer for homeowners looking to incorporate
  battery-powered OPE.

The first clue that battery powered equipment like string trimmers, leaf blowers and the like were viable was when the professionals started using them. Think of it; if you're running a lawn care business or maintaining large property, there's a big risk in having downtime in the form of dead batteries.  Gas is reilable for these pros because they aren't dependent on available outlets to re-charge equipment. Down time is lost revenue, and whilIe that may not mean as much for DIY types, it does mean that by and large you can rely on the current equipment to meet your needs.

### How to make the leap...

If you're a recent homebuyer, you may not have all the equipment you need (or would like to have) to take care of your yard, and if you have owned for a while you might have an older piece of equipment that doesn't meet your current needs, or is at the end of its lifespan. For either of these reasons, starting with one piece and potentially expanding in future seasons is a great strategy. 

One consideration - the biggest names in the market typically have OTHER tools using the same battery pack across the range, making it ideal that you stay in a brand to maxmize your investment. As an example, if you have tools by Milwuakee already, you may consider checking out their line of tools because you can often invest without buying more batteries and chargers.

### The benefits of batteries

There are a number of reasons why batteries are the best choice for residential users, and they can be broken into two categories; convenience and environmental. On the convenience side, batteries mean no need to mix gas/oil as well as store it, it also means no need to winterize units out of season. While run times vary from tool to tool and one manufacturer to another, the typical home user can expect to finish the job on a single charge.

On the environmental side, battery powered equipment is not only quieter, it is also a drastic reduction in exposure to harmful emissions of carbon monoxide, fine particulate matter and Volatile Organic Compunds (VOCs) such as benzene and formaldehyde. All of these present health risks for users, and it should be noted that a gas-powered lawnmower run for one hour, has the [equivalent emissions of driving 11 new cars for one hour each](https://www.peoplepoweredmachines.com/faq-environment.htm).

All things considered, it would appear to be a wise personal decision to cut that out of your yard work.

### **What is available?**

This seems to grow every season, but currently you can get all the following in battery powered variations:

\- String Trimmer\
- Leaf Blower\
- Chainsaw\
- Hedge Trimmer\
- Power broom\
- Lawn mowers (including ride-on and robot mowers\
- Snow blowers\
- Wheel barrows

That's probably not all that's out there, but in each item above at least two manufacturers report selling that item. Some big names are familiar brands to anyone who owns cordless tools, and others specialize in only outdoor power equipment. These include Dewalt, Black & Decker, Ryobi, Makita, Milwuakee, Ego, Stihl, and Greenworks to name a few.

### Real world application

I found myself in the position of needing a new string trimmer last year. After replacing two carburetors in the ten years I owned a gas string trimmer (Even with diligent care and maintenance) I found the unit wouldn't start. Considering that I had easily doubled the unit cost in maintenance and repair, I took a look at a battery version. The cost came out very close with a sale promotion, and taking gas costs into account, I would be ahead within a year of use cost-wise.  I also happened to be able to buy the same brand of typical power tools I own, allowing me to more efficiently rotate batteries and maximize their lifespan. 

The real surprise came soon afterward - the battery powered system is more than adequate to trim the edges of gardens and lawn as well as many tree trunks through the yard, and the supplied battery lasted 4 separate sessions of the chore before needing recharge, and this is for a yard over half an acre!

While I am sure my neighbors love the 45 year old sit on top mower we still use, that will be the next thing to go. Currently we could not mow our lawn without changing batteries at least once during the job, it is doable, and the efficiency is likely to improve in the near future.

### Considerations

As I have noted above, a lot of the usability depends on your yard size and specific needs. A homeowner living in Minneapolis on a .14 acre lot can make use of any tool available, and do so on a single charge. Someone with more square footage/acreage, or specific landscaping needs may not be an ideal fit for EVERY tool available.

When buying, consider the run time of a battery on each tool type, and know that variable speed options, brushless motors, and charge time for each brand can make a big difference in tools. You can also take advantage of manufactuer's promotions that often sell tool kits as a sale, or throw in additional batteries during certain times of the year.
